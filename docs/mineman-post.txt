[FONT=Arial][SIZE=3]So here I am looking at the forums and I just found a new thread category, Builds show-off! Just what I needed :P
So I thought of showing my buildings on Massivecraft from my earliest to my latest.[/SIZE][/FONT]

[FONT=Arial][SIZE=3]I consider my biggest accomplishment in this server the foundation of the best Orc faction I've seen. And although there were a few Orc factions around - some I never seen them because I've not been always active - none has been like [B]Pariahfolk[/B]. I feel like it should be showed off to some folks that seek inspiration or simply for tell a bit of Massive's history.

[URL='http://map.massivecraft.com/?worldname=ithania&mapname=isometric&zoom=5&x=-27&y=64&z=2064'][B]Here is Pariahfolk[/B][/URL], now sold to the server, and a bunch of screenies. Most of them were built by [B]me[/B], [B]CptSabis [/B]and [B]Eltongo[/B], both inactive.[/SIZE][/FONT]
[SIZE=3][FONT=Arial]And [/FONT][B][FONT=Arial]no [/FONT][/B][FONT=Arial]Pariahfolk, the player, is not responsible for anything related with this faction looking, despite the rumors. He was just a member, a family member.[/FONT][/SIZE]

[FONT=Arial][SIZE=3]Later, when I went back from inactivity, me, CptSabis and Eltongo decided on building an evil faction, [B][URL='http://map.massivecraft.com/?worldname=newceardia&mapname=isometric&zoom=5&x=5054&y=64&z=7256']Crematorium[/URL][/B]. Turns out we never actually made it and eventually became my storage. But here is the screenies :D

Right after Crematorium was made I joined my girlfriend's faction [B][URL='http://map.massivecraft.com/?worldname=fendarfell&mapname=isometric&zoom=5&x=1395&y=64&z=1125']Brightshore[/URL][/B], where I made a few random houses and hangout builds for it :)

But eventually we all went inactive at Brightshore... And came back with a new project - with the name of [B][URL='http://map.massivecraft.com/?worldname=newceardia&mapname=flat&zoom=4&x=6093&y=64&z=9604']Sandkeepers[/URL].[/B]

[URL='http://map.massivecraft.com/?worldname=ithania&mapname=isometric&zoom=5&x=-3771&y=64&z=687']This was a remake of my old Orc faction[/URL], after it finnaly got deleted from the survival worlds. We planned on building an Orc village with all substantial workshops needed for any faction survival. We made ourselves known again, although I couldn't leave the faction where I am now, with all my friends, which is Raptum.

[FONT=Arial][SIZE=3]Although before we stopped with PariahFolk project we began a new one. [URL='http://map.massivecraft.com/?worldname=teledmethen&mapname=isometric&zoom=6&x=6118&y=64&z=36']A pirate themed faction[/URL]. It was inspired by the Portuguese Empire during the Age of Discovery. One of the biggest nautical myths were solved by a Portuguese fleet that crossed the so called Cape of Storms (Cabo das Tormentas, in Portuguese). That's where this new faction got it's name Tormentor. [URL='http://map.massivecraft.com/?worldname=teledmethen&mapname=isometric&zoom=6&x=6118&y=64&z=36']The faction itself was run inside a copy of a Galley.[/URL]

This is my current faction and where most of my friends are in. In Raptum I've built a Warzone Arena (which got deleted afterwards) and our current Fhome building which was thought to be used for The Qaliphate, Raptum's Empire at the time. [URL='http://map.massivecraft.com/?worldname=ithania&mapname=isometric&zoom=5&x=718&y=64&z=2818']It is a merge between the famous Hanging Guardens and the Pyramid of Babylon.[/URL]
